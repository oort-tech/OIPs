### Mainnet Bootup Scheme: Genesis Witness Staking

In [OIP2](https://github.com/oort-tech/OIPs/blob/master/OIPS/oip-2.md), the Oort witness node and staking pool creation rule was proposed. 

For Olympus Protocol to function properly in a distributed and decentralized manner, our Protocol requires the establishment of a minimum **50** Witnesses, which at launch will be called Genesis Witnesses. 

The Oort foundation will create and stake for 14 Genesis Witnesses and the rest **36** will be built by the community. More witnesses shall be created along with the development of Oort community and ecosystem.


Considering limited Oort mainnet token liquidity after the initial launch, we propose a mechanism for Oort’s community to stake Huygens tokens. Huygens (CCN) staking pools will be created from 36 Genesis Witnesses. 

Considering each Genesis Witness has the staking capacity of 500k CCN (from [OIP2](https://github.com/oort-tech/OIPs/blob/master/OIPS/oip-2.md)). The total pool size would be 36*500k = 18 million CCN tokens.

Oort’s mainnet will start to run immediately once all the 50 genesis witnesses are activated. All Witness Pools and stakers begin to earn rewards at launch of Olympus Protocol. 

Staking will be locked at the launch of mainnet with a lockup period of **6 months**. Post 6-month lock-up period, staked Huygens tokens will be burned, and converted to Oort’s mainnet native tokens which will be distributed to all stakeholders' wallets. 

Consider the “Genesis Witness” staking program as **one of the ways** to convert the Huygens CCN token to Olympus Protocol’s native token.

Yields from the Genesis Witness operations, **Oort's mainnet tokens**, will be allocated to stakeholders based on their respective share of the pool they belong to. The distributions will occur on a **weekly** basis.
